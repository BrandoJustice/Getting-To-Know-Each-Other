                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>I was born in Chicago and have lived here my whole life with my mother and father. My father passed away from Brain Cancer in 2019, and it has been hard on me and my mom. I was close to my father. He was a game programmer, and I learned so much from him. I miss talking to him and watching him code. My mom and I are doing good and have learned to live with losing my dad, but I admit it is always there.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I am currently in my last year at Lewis University, working towards my Bachelor's in Computer Science. When I graduate, I hope to get a job as a programmer and code applications to help other people, especially teens and adults with disabilities like autism, I have autism and I understand.</p>

                        <h2>What I Hope to Learn<br>in this Course</h2>
                        <p>I hope to learn more about the SCRUM method and how to build applications more efficiently. I hope to learn more SCRUM skills to help me be a better programmer for my future career. I also look forward to learning more soft skills and being a good team member on a development team.</p>
